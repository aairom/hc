# 1. Toolchain Overview

With **Continuous Delivery**, you can build, test, and deliver applications by using DevOps practices and industry-leading tools.

The Continuous Delivery service supports your DevOps workflows:

- You can create integrated DevOps open toolchains to enable tool integrations that support your development, deployment, and operations tasks.

  A toolchain is an integrated set of tools that you can use to collaboratively develop, build, deploy, test, and manage applications and make operations repeatable and easier to manage. Toolchains can include open source tools, IBM Cloud services, such as IBM® Cloud DevOps Insights, and third-party tools, such as GitHub, PagerDuty, and Slack.

  DevOps Insights is available only in the US South region.

- Deliver continuously by using automated pipelines.

  Automate builds, unit tests, deployments, and more. Build, test, and deploy in a repeatable way with minimal human intervention. Be ready to release into production at any time.

- Edit and push your code from anywhere by using the web-based IDE.

  Create, edit, run, and debug, and complete source-control tasks in GitHub. Seemlessly move from editing your code to deploying it to production.

- Collaborate with your team and manage your source code with a Git repository (repos) and issue tracker that is hosted by IBM and built on GitLab Community Edition.

  Manage Git repos through fine-grained access controls that keep code secure. Review code and enhance collaboration through merge requests. Track issues and share ideas through the issue tracker. Document projects on the wiki system.

Open **toolchains** are available in the Public and Dedicated environments on IBM® Cloud. You can create a toolchain in two ways: use a template to create a toolchain or create a toolchain from an app. As a starting point, you can use a toolchain template. Depending on the template that you use, you can create a toolchain that has a specific set of tool integrations or an empty toolchain that you can add tool integrations to.

On IBM Cloud Public, depending on the template or toolchain that you use, the toolchain might include a GitHub or Git repository (repo) that is populated with app starter code and a preconfigured delivery pipeline. When you push changes to the toolchain's repo, the delivery pipeline automatically builds and deploys the app to IBM Cloud.

On IBM Cloud Dedicated, depending on the template or toolchain that you use, the toolchain might include a GitHub or GitHub Enterprise repo that is populated with app starter code and a preconfigured delivery pipeline. When you push changes to the toolchain's GitHub or GitHub Enterprise repo, the delivery pipeline automatically builds and deploys the apps to IBM Cloud.

### Objectives 

In this lab, you create a toolchain from a template that contains a specific set of tool integrations and code to develop and deploy a sample Cloud Foundry app that is written in Node.js. The toolchain is preconfigured for continuous delivery, source control, issue tracking, and online editing. After you create the toolchain, you change the app's code and push the change to the Git Repos and Issue Tracking repository (repo). When you push changes to your repo, the delivery pipeline automatically builds and deploys the code that is in the repo.

# 4. Modify the application



### Task 1 : Access Orion

In this tutorial, you will use the Eclipse **Orion** Web IDE to modify source code. When you edit in the Web IDE, your changes are saved to your cloud workspace. When you commit a change, it is saved to a Git repo on the cloud. When you push or sync a change, it is pushed to the origin Git repo (remote repo). Synching a change also saves the change from the remote repo to your Git repo and workspace on the cloud. You can also use the GitLab editor or your favorite editor to modify your app's code.

On the toolchain Overview page, click **Eclipse Orion Web IDE**. Your GitHub repo is automatically loaded in your workspace.

![image-20200313151834935](images/image-20200313151834935-4109114.png)

The name of the repo that is shown in the file navigator is the name that you specified for the sample GitHub Enterprise repo when you created the toolchain.

![image-20190701145808407](images/image-20190701145808407-1985888.png)



### Task 2 : Navigate into the repo

In the file navigator, expand the repo for your current toolchain and go to the **app.js** file in the public folder. 

![image-20190701150151754](images/image-20190701150151754-1986111.png)



### Task 3 : Modify the file

Change the res.send line to change the text that is displayed by the deployed app. Your changes are automatically saved.

![image-20190701150235934](images/image-20190701150235934-1986155.png)

From the Eclipse Orion Web IDE menu, click the Git icon

![IBM Cloud Dashboard](./images/t150.png)

#  Results
<span style="background-color:yellow;">Successful exercise ! </span>

You learned how to continuously integrate and deploy an app to IBM Cloud by using a **toolchain**. You created a toolchain from a template that included a GitHub repo with a Node.js Hello World app and a delivery pipeline. You changed your app's code by using the Eclipse Orion Web IDE and added a stage to the pipeline. When you pushed the updated code, your change was built and deployed automatically.
